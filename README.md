This writing is must-read for employees, essentially...

...with some care taken for relevancy. Marketing doesn't necessary need
to read programming expectations.

What's not here:

* Internal documentation, like strategy and post mortem, is elsewhere.
* My thoughts which I deem publishable but don't necessary want to *make*
the employees read will go elsewhere, a blog.

This repository is a drafting area for the manual.
