uses hatchling for lib

app - basic info (project name, dependencies)
app + package - authorhsip, build system, project.scripts

lib - basic + build system
lib-package - same as lib

lib-app - doesn't work, but really should, if you follow a UI Hierachal design:

library, maybe exposed as an API, accessible from CLI, and then perhaps used to construct a GUI.

do both python script.py and python -m script run as __name__=main

`uv run --no-project script.py` to not install project

uv init --script
tool will do ephemeral stuff
--no-project will ignore project in run
but are inline scripts always ephemeral? YES! project always ignored (assuming.., and it is cache)
