The overall goals are to:
- securely manage environments
- provide resources for employees
  - development resources
  - guides on company expectations

- We need `systory`, a way to track change to the system (I think this is currently the best option)
- We need a way to manage users on a system, and manage their access to certain resources
  - TODO
  - TODO
  - TODO
  - How to manage keys and stuff?
- `status`
  - We need a way to track the status of a system (logs, cpu, memory, and network activity, systemd, updates, uptime)
    - This probably means a status bar
    - This also means a more verbose report
      - Probably need some kind of process tree
    - It should sometimes be cached
  - All of these things need to be available form in system as well as sent to a central server for display in a dashboard
- `isgitsynced` - just checks to show you what you've committed and whats dirty (for dev environments) (works in one environment and in system to list all)
- Universal `depstatus` command: What does the status command do, for active environments:
  - You would use this if you start working in an environment or if its an environment you expect to be updated.
  - Searches tree backwards for whatever indicator of an environment (.git, .venv, pyproject.toml, package.json, go.mod)
    - If nothing found, assumes we're checking the system (arch or debian)
    - If its a python env or system env, it also does `uv tool`
  - What if its a python env?
    - Is the .venv synced?
    - Are there updates available w/in the .venv?
    - How do scripts work?
      - TODO TODO
  - Check uv tools are updated?
  - What if its arch?
    - Use `checkupdates`
  - What if its a golang app?
    - This is tough, I need to revist this, because golang's go.mod doesn't really let me track things the way I want
    - I want a go.mod template that refreshes go.mod, I need to learn more about it
  - What if its debian?
    - `apt-show-versions -u` or other
  - What if its a git repo?
    - `git fetch`
    - `git status`
    - `git status` of submodules
- Git management
  - Probably need a server which is our git server, it can be pretty light, but it has to be fast
  - Will probably have to run git tea
  - Need a better review system
    - Step through changes
    - Mark which changes have been stepped through
    - Look at the final result of a certain file on a branch
    - Add comments to commits, mark as resolved or not, notify people, should be similiar to github
  - Needs to push automatically to github
    - TODO: How to handle external prs, probably can sync the opposite way with github as well, notified if there is one
  - Can commits be rejected?
- Github management
  - This is mainly a publication/documentation interface, as well as for bugs and external PRs
  - Does each repo have the correct checks?
  - What repos are visible, etc?
  - What are the changes on each one?
  - What PR's do you have open on other repos?
- Website management
