Our two supported editors, neovim and code.

# Vim

There is vim stuff in the cheatsheet, but it takes practice.

github.com/geopozo/neovim-collection has some configs that are good as well as
our pytemp plugin which allows two good commands:

`:PyTemp` and `:PyIt` for starting temporary files.

Use the README.md there for the rest.

# VS Code

Plugins I like:

vim
editorconfig
ruff

Settings I change:

default terminal
columns (ruler)
wordwrap (at 80)
